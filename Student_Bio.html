	<p>"Now this is the story all about how
	My life got flipped, turned upside down
	And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
	I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
	In west Philadelphia born and raised
	On the playground where I spent most of my days
	Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
	And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
	When a couple of guys who were up to no good
	Started making trouble in my neighborhood
	I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
	And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Airs" </p>
